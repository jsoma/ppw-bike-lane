    <p><strong>Hi, I'm Soma.</strong> Catch me at <a href="http://twitter.com/dangerscarf">@dangerscarf</a>.</p>

      <h1>The Important Numbers on the PPW Bike Lane</h1>
      <p>The <strong>Prospect Park West</strong> bike lane has generated a lot of controversy, and I don't understand
        why. I looked at <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/20110120_ppw.pdf">an ugly PDF full of numbers</a> from the DoT about it, and it's
        made the street safer for bikes, pedestrians <em>and</em> cars.</p>
      <p>I made this page this morning so you don't have to look at that ugly PDF. I'm not some crazy bicyclist, I'm 
        just a guy who'd rather not <strong>get hit by anything with wheels</strong>.*</p>
      <p class="tinynote">* Yes, that includes bikes.</p>

    <div id="sidewalk">
      <h1>Sidewalk Safety</h1>
      <p>Riding a bike on a sidewalk is <strong>four times more dangerous</strong> than cycling in the road, and
        any accident has a greater chance of involving pedestrians.</p>
      <div class="bikes">
        <div class="before">
          <h3>Before the bike lane...</h3>
          <p>Almost <strong class="bad">half</strong> of all bikes rode on the sidewalk.</p>

            <div class="filler good" style="width: 3%"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="conclusion"><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> Bicyclists used to be idiots, but now they've stopped 
          riding on the sidewalk. Sidewalks are <em>much</em> safer for people and their tiny dogs. Bicyclists
          are safer by not being on the sidewalk, too.</p>

    <div id="popularity">
      <h1>Bike Lane Popularity</h1>
      <p>It doesn't have to do with safety, but seeing how used the bike lane is might tell us something.</p>
      <div class="bikes">
        <div class="before">
          <h3>Before the bike lane...</h3>
          <p>Around <strong>349</strong> cyclists used PPW on a given day.</p>
          <div class="bar">
            <div class="filler good" style="width: 35%"></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="after">
          <h3>After the bike lane...</h3>
          <p>Around <strong>1010</strong> cyclists used PPW on a given day.</p>
          <div class="bar">
            <div class="filler good" style="width: 100%"></div>
          </div>
          <p>94% used the bike lane.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="conclusion"><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> The number of bicyclists on Prospect Park West basically
          <strong>tripled</strong>. I doubt anyone started biking <em>because</em> of the bike lane, so I'm guessing
          they were on other, more dangerous streets beforehand. I think "popular <em>and</em> safe" is a rare combination.</p>

        <div class="before">
          <h3>Before the bike lane...</h3>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="tinynote">* Yes, the 'after' cyclists salmoning are eschewing the bike lane to ride <em>against traffic on the road.</em></p>
        <p>So as not to be deceiving: <strong>16</strong> were counted before the lane and <strong>19</strong> were counted
          after, so the actual number of salmoning cyclists between those 2 days actually increased.</p>
        <p class="conclusion"><strong>CONCLUSION A:</strong> We tripled the number of cyclists using PPW, but
          halved the percentage of them riding against the current.</p>
        <p class="conclusion"><strong>CONCLUSION B:</strong> Yes, raw numbers are up, but I'd bet you anything that some of 
          those 600 extra cyclists were previously salmoning up other streets.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="conclusion"><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> I'm sorry there isn't a chart, but that's

        </div>
        <p>The bullet points contained the most the interesting part - there have been <em>no pedestrian injuries</em> 
          since the bike lane was installed.</p>
        <p class="conclusion"><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> There are about 15% fewer crashes, as well as a very reduced
          chance of them resulting in injury, despite the fact that there are <em>three times as many cyclists</em> using
          the same space. I'm kinda impressed.</p>

    <a name="conclusion"></a>
    <div id="ultimate-conclusion">
      <h1>The Ultimate Conclusion</h1>
      <p>By adding the bike lane, <strong>unsafe behavior</strong> by both cars and bikes has <strong>plummeted</strong>.
        That's safer for everyone.</p>
      <p>Beyond being safe, it <strong>hasn't caused any problems for motorists</strong>. Same number of cars, same
        time to get down the street; everything's working just like it was before, except everything's safer.</p>
      <p>I hear these days the anti-bike-lane crowd is trying to make the bike lane only go one way. It's probably
        just going to make cyclists go back onto the sidewalk and cause more trouble there, or go down less safe streets
        that don't have bike lanes (7th Ave is pretty bad news like that). If you don't like bikes, at least now you've
        got them contained.</p>

      <p>I think the only math I did on my end was for bike counts (I used the 6/9/09 and 10/12/10 sets), averaging the
        peak AM and PM times under 'Congestion' and counting how many cars were going 40+ MPH. If you'd like to
        nitpick about sample size or anything, I hear you on that, but these trends seem pretty clear.</p>
